* Making your FIrst Rust App
** Setup
   *** My setup uses NixOS - for nix based development use direnv/nix-direnv + lorri as replacements for nix-shell to configure project local settings
   
   Create shell.nix and .envrc 
   #+begin_src sh
   nixify .
   #+end_src

   Or
   #+begin_src sh
   lorri init
   #+end_src
   
   *** Setup a new Rust project
   
   Install Rustip + IDE amenities
   #+begin_src sh
   % curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   % rustup update
   % rustup component add rls rust-analysis rust-src
   % which rls
   #+end_src

   Define the toolchain version
   #+begin_src sh
   rustup default stable
   #+end_src

   Scaffold new project - e.g. numbers
   #+begin_src sh
   cargo new numbers
   #+end_src

** Rust Crates
Rust distinguishes libraries from executable binaries by the presence of a lib.rs and main.rs
The differences between them are largely nominal and it is common practice to create a library alongside a binary
